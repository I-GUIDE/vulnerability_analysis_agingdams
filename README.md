# Vulnerability Analysis for Aging Dams

Due to their low resilience to the disaster, the socioeconomically vulnerable populations should be prioritized to be protected from aging dam failure. At the national level (419 federal dams in the contiguous United States), we aim to identify and cluster the dams based on the socioeconomic characteristics of the population impacted by potential dam failure. Our analysis proceeds in the following three steps. First, we identify inundated and non-inundated census tracts from a dam failure with a worst-case scenario: Maximum Height (MH)-Breach. Second, we utilized a t-test to investigate whether inundated census tracts have higher social vulnerability than non-inundated ones. Here, we employed seven census variables out of the well-known social vulnerability index: no high school diploma, population below poverty level, not fluent in English, mobile home residents, no vehicle households, unemployment rate, and people aged over 65. Third, we conducted K-means clustering to group dams based on the t-score of each variable. Our results show that the dams are classified into four categories based on the populations that they potentially have an impact on 1) socioeconomically vulnerable populations (i.e., no high school diploma, poverty, not fluent in English, no vehicle, and unemployment), 2) advantageous populations, 3) neither vulnerable nor advantageous, and 4) not advantageous but partially vulnerable (i.e., mobile home residents and older people). Our further investigation of the dam locations found that most dams potentially impacting socioeconomically vulnerable populations are in California, Colorado, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Especially, dam failure in Los Angeles County would affect the vulnerable population, as the overflow would pass by downtown Los Angeles.
